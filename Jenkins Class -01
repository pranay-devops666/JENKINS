CI & CD

Continius Integration & Continous Deployment

Continous Integration ------> It is the combination of continous build & continous continous test

Continous Integration = Continous Build + Continous Test

Continous Integration
=======================

Whenever a developer commits the code using Source code management like GIT, then CI pipeline gets the changes of the code runs automatically build and unit test.

* Due to integrating the new code with old code, we can easily get to know the code is a success or failure.
* It finds the Error more quickly
* Delivery the products to client more frequently
* Developers dont need to manual tasks
* Reduces the developers time 20% to 30%


Before CI & After CI
====================

Before CI
============

CI Server 

Here Buil, Test & Deploy all these activities are performed in a single CI Server

CI Server = Build + Test

After CI
===========




Continous Delivery/Deployment 
===================================

Continous Delivery
===================

Continous Delivery is making it avilable for deploymen. Anytime a new build artifact is automatically placed it in the desired environment and deployed.

Continous Deployment
=====================

Continous Deployment is when you commit your code then its get automatically tested, build and deploy on the production server.

Example:- Spotify, Facebook

CI/CD Pipeline:
=================

--->Version Control--------> Build ----------> Unit Test ------------> Deploy -----------> Auto Test ------------> Deploy to Production Measure + Validate
|------------------------------------------------------------Production Feedback---------------------------------------------|


* Its looks like Software Development Life Cycle, But let's see how it works
* Lets Consider an example, if you are developing a web application.

CODE          BUILD        TEST         DEPLOY
Stage-1      Stage-2      Stage-3      Stage-4


CI/CD ------------------> Pipelines

Jenkins: Pipeline

* Jenkins is an open source project written an JAVA by kohsuke kawaguchi it runs on the window, Linux and Mac OS
* It is community supported, free to use, and the first choice for continous Integration.
* Consists of plugins
* Automate the Entire Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
* It was originally developed by Sun MicroSystem in 2004 as HUDSON.
* HUDSON was an enterprise edition we need to pay for it.

1. The project was renamed Jenkins when Oracle brought the Microsystems.

* It can run on any major platform without Compatibility issues.
* whenever developers write code, we integrate all the code of all developers at any point in time and we build, test and deploy it to the client. 
This is called CI/CD.




Launch one Ec2-Instance----------> Name: CI-Server----------> 6.1 kernel version --------> c7i-flex-large ----------> with key pair----------> Security group 
(1.ssh, anywhere 2.custom TCP, port range:8080)--------> 8gb volume ------------> launch Instance & Connect Instance

Below Commands for practice

1. yum install java-17-amazon-correctto -y ----------------> Command to install java-17th version

2. open a new browser tab---------> jenkins.io -------> enter

3. yum install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
java -version
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo     https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
yum install jenkins -y
systemctl status jenkins
systemctl start jenkins
systemctl status jenkins

4. ll /etc/yum.repos.d/ -------------> enter

jenkins.repo file will appear

5. after getting jenkins started --------------> do copy public IP of EC2-Instance and paste in a new tab with port number 8080

6. Administrator password will be asked for the passowrd path will also be given over there

7. /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword----------> give this password like this way below

8. cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword ------------> after giving like this one secret password will come

9. do paste that password and continue

10. Jenkins Dashboard has been launched


From Code to Deployment: The Power of Jenkins in CI/CD
===========================================================

Jenkins is a powerful tool that simplifies the software delivery process. It’s a flexible platform used for a variety of software engineering tasks, 
but its main focus is managing CI/CD pipelines. Jenkins ensures that code changes are tested, validated, and deployed efficiently.

In this article, we’ll dive into the key features, benefits, and real-world uses of Jenkins in modern software development. 
We’ll also explore how it plays a crucial role in DevOps practices.

What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool designed for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

It automates tasks like building, testing, and deploying code, triggered by events such as commits, branch updates, or pull requests.

Jenkins supports different environments, making it highly versatile for various development workflows.

Its extensive plugin ecosystem allows easy integration with a wide range of tools and technologies.

Built with Java, Jenkins works seamlessly across multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

What is Jenkins Used For?
Build Automation: Jenkins automates the building of software projects, ensuring consistent and reliable results.

Testing: It integrates with testing tools to automatically execute tests and validate code changes.

Deployment: Jenkins simplifies the deployment of applications across different environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: It orchestrates continuous integration and delivery pipelines, streamlining the software delivery process.

Workflow Management: Jenkins handles complex workflows across multiple stages of development.

Tool Integration: It integrates seamlessly with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes, covering all phases of the software development lifecycle.

Monitoring and Reporting: Jenkins monitors builds and deployments, providing detailed reports on successes, failures, and performance metrics.

Is Jenkins a CI or CD Tool?
Jenkins is primarily a Continuous Integration (CI) tool but is also widely used for Continuous Delivery (CD).

Continuous Integration (CI):

CI focuses on automating the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository.

Jenkins helps development teams merge and test code in the version control system, triggering pipelines that build and run test cases automatically.

The main goal of CI is to provide developers with quick feedback to identify and fix bugs early, reducing risks before deploying to production.

Continuous Delivery (CD):

CD ensures that software releases are prepared in a reliable and automated way, ready to be deployed into higher environments.

Jenkins supports CD by creating deployment artifacts, managing dependencies, and configuring environment-specific variables.

Unlike Continuous Deployment, CD typically involves a manual approval step before releasing builds to production, adding an extra layer of control.

Integration with Git: Jenkins integrates with Git repositories where developers collaborate and commit code changes.

It automatically detects changes in the repository and triggers the build process.

The build process includes compilation, testing, and error reporting, providing quick feedback to developers.

This ensures a faster development cycle without impacting the production environment.

Automation in Continuous Delivery:

Jenkins automates tasks like managing dependencies and creating deployment artifacts.

Common artifacts include JAR files for Java applications and container images for containerized deployments.

These artifacts are pushed to appropriate repositories, ready for deployment.

Robust Plugin Ecosystem:

Jenkins is open-source and extensible, supported by a large community.

Its extensive plugin library enables integration with tools for version control, source code management, testing frameworks, deployment, reporting, and more.

This modular design allows organizations to build flexible and highly customized pipelines tailored to their specific workflows.

Conclusion
Jenkins is a cornerstone tool in modern software development, empowering teams to automate and streamline their CI/CD workflows. 
By integrating with tools like Git and leveraging its extensive plugin ecosystem, Jenkins simplifies complex tasks such as 
building, testing, and deploying applications. Its flexibility, extensibility, and robust community support make 
it a reliable choice for organizations aiming to enhance their development pipelines. 
Whether it’s reducing errors, providing faster feedback, or enabling seamless delivery, J
enkins plays a crucial role in accelerating the software development lifecycle and supporting DevOps practices.
