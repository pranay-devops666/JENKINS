TOPIC: JENKINS INTRODUCTION & JENKINS SET-UP


CI & CD

Continius Integration & Continous Deployment

Continous Integration ------> It is the combination of continous build & continous continous test

Continous Integration = Continous Build + Continous Test

Continous Integration
=======================

Whenever a developer commits the code using Source code management like GIT, then CI pipeline gets the changes of the code runs automatically build and unit test.

* Due to integrating the new code with old code, we can easily get to know the code is a success or failure.
* It finds the Error more quickly
* Delivery the products to client more frequently
* Developers dont need to manual tasks
* Reduces the developers time 20% to 30%


Before CI & After CI
====================

Before CI
============

CI Server 

Here Buil, Test & Deploy all these activities are performed in a single CI Server

CI Server = Build + Test

After CI
===========




Continous Delivery/Deployment 
===================================

Continous Delivery
===================

Continous Delivery is making it avilable for deploymen. Anytime a new build artifact is automatically placed it in the desired environment and deployed.

Continous Deployment
=====================

Continous Deployment is when you commit your code then its get automatically tested, build and deploy on the production server.

Example:- Spotify, Facebook

CI/CD Pipeline:
=================

--->Version Control--------> Build ----------> Unit Test ------------> Deploy -----------> Auto Test ------------> Deploy to Production Measure + Validate
|------------------------------------------------------------Production Feedback---------------------------------------------|


* Its looks like Software Development Life Cycle, But let's see how it works
* Lets Consider an example, if you are developing a web application.

CODE          BUILD        TEST         DEPLOY
Stage-1      Stage-2      Stage-3      Stage-4


CI/CD ------------------> Pipelines

Jenkins: Pipeline

* Jenkins is an open source project written an JAVA by kohsuke kawaguchi it runs on the window, Linux and Mac OS
* It is community supported, free to use, and the first choice for continous Integration.
* Consists of plugins
* Automate the Entire Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
* It was originally developed by Sun MicroSystem in 2004 as HUDSON.
* HUDSON was an enterprise edition we need to pay for it.

1. The project was renamed Jenkins when Oracle brought the Microsystems.

* It can run on any major platform without Compatibility issues.
* whenever developers write code, we integrate all the code of all developers at any point in time and we build, test and deploy it to the client. 
This is called CI/CD.




Launch one Ec2-Instance----------> Name: CI-Server----------> 6.1 kernel version --------> c7i-flex-large ----------> with key pair----------> Security group 
(1.ssh, anywhere 2.custom TCP, port range:8080)--------> 8gb volume ------------> launch Instance & Connect Instance

Below Commands for practice

1. yum install java-17-amazon-correctto -y ----------------> Command to install java-17th version

2. open a new browser tab---------> jenkins.io -------> enter

3. yum install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
java -version
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo     https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
yum install jenkins -y
systemctl status jenkins
systemctl start jenkins
systemctl status jenkins

4. ll /etc/yum.repos.d/ -------------> enter

jenkins.repo file will appear

5. after getting jenkins started --------------> do copy public IP of EC2-Instance and paste in a new tab with port number 8080

6. Administrator password will be asked for the passowrd path will also be given over there

7. /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword----------> give this password like this way below

8. cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword ------------> after giving like this one secret password will come

9. do paste that password and continue

10. Jenkins Dashboard has been launched
