Jenkins Class -02


TOPIC: GIT INTEGRATED WITH JENKINS


Launch one Ec2-Instance----------> Name: CI-Server----------> 6.1 kernel version --------> c7i-flex-large ----------> with key pair----------> Security group 
(1.ssh, anywhere 2.custom TCP, port range:8080)--------> 8gb volume ------------> launch Instance & Connect Instance

Below Commands for practice

1. yum install java-17-amazon-correctto -y ----------------> Command to install java-17th version

2. open a new browser tab---------> jenkins.io -------> enter

3. yum install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
java -version
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo     https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
yum install jenkins -y
systemctl status jenkins
systemctl start jenkins
systemctl status jenkins

4. ll /etc/yum.repos.d/ -------------> enter

jenkins.repo file will appear

5. after getting jenkins started --------------> do copy public IP of EC2-Instance and paste in a new tab with port number 8080

6. Administrator password will be asked for the passowrd path will also be given over there

7. /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword----------> give this password like this way below

8. cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword ------------> after giving like this one secret password will come

9. do paste that password and continue

10. Jenkins Dashboard has been Launched

11. Go to Jenkins Dashboard-----------> select create a New Job--------> select free-style---->ok

12. select that created job -------------> do configure the job-------> select GIT ------> repo url: copy & paste here github repo-url

13. Jenkins Dashboard has been launched


now we need to get the code having inside github automatically into a CI server ci server means jenkins EC2-Instance

for this process we will create a pipeline here

suppose when the developer made changes like commit and done push in acode those changes will get pull to CI Server automatically

what will happen if this process automatically is Build + Test will be done 

first we need to create a Job

Job is nothing but a task

first go to Jenkins dashboard----------> select create a job -----------> name:whatever our wish--------------> select freestyle------>ok

selct created job------------> do configure ---------> select GIT -------> copy & paste git-hub url-repo (provide always https, ssh will wont work in jenkins)
---------> click -------> build now

after build was get success

now code will get to CI Server(Jenkins Server)

In Interview they will ask 

If the pipeline will get faied what you will do
Ans.I will open the console output to check the logs

For automation ---------> means whenever the developer made changes ina code and done commits that changes will be happen in application automatically no need to 
build manual

for this we will use web-hook process

first go to github ---------> select one repo public/private---------> select settings ---------> select developer settings------> select webhooks--------> add 
webhook---------> payload url: https:publicIp of ec2-instance:8080/github-webhook/(jenkins url)--------> content type: application/json--------> add

open created job-------> do configure------> select triggers----------> GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling----------> save

now when the developer made changes into a code automatically changes will may apply to application as well
